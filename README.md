# Core Java Projects

## Overview
This repository contains multiple **Core Java projects** that I developed over the past few years. These projects cover various topics, including **data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming (OOP), and Java-based applications**.

## Projects Included
**`airline-reservation-system`** - A Java-based airline reservation system.  
**`contacts`** - A simple Java application for managing contacts.  
**`EmployeeManagement`** - A console-based employee management system.  
**`Pokerito`** - A card game implemented in Java.  
**`RockPaperScissor`** - A simple CLI-based Rock Paper Scissors game.  
**`Sorting Algos`** - Implementations of different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.).   
**`TicTacToe`** - A Java-based Tic Tac Toe game.  
**`vending-machine`** - A vending machine simulator written in Java.  

## Features
**Core Java Concepts** - Includes OOP, multithreading, collections, and more.  
**Data Structures & Algorithms** - Sorting, searching, and other fundamental algorithms.  
**Game Implementations** - Fun projects like Tic Tac Toe, Pokerito, and Rock Paper Scissors.  
**Real-world Applications** - Employee management, contact management, and vending machine simulation.
